# igraph-sugiyama
igraph sugiyama graph layout algorithm in C

to compile:   
./autogen.sh   
./configure   
make   
cd src   
./sugi   

This is the sugiyama graph algrotithm from igraph library in C with brandes and kopf horizontal placement algorithm  

This has a initial gtk+ gui  

The main.c program does a graph layout as test.  

The problem with newer igrph library is that it is turned in c++ source and needs c++ compiler.
